            <p class="lgray-text">The Toucan Rescue Ranch’s (TRR) mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release Costa Rican wildlife. TRR works with a model that focuses on conservation, education, and research to ensure a brighter tomorrow for native wildlife. TRR works closely with the Ministry of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica (MINAE) who rescues wildlife and brings them to our facility. TRR provides sanctuary while giving premier medical treatment, rehabilitation, and eventual release into its natural environment.</p>

                        <p>Lil Sebastian is about 3-4 weeks old now. He was found on the forest floor covered in ticks, dirt and with diarrhea. We don’t know what happened to his mom or if he just got too weak to hold on and that’s why he fell. Luckily now he is thriving in our care.</p>

Lizzo is flying through our rehabilitation stages in preparation for her release, she is very close to entering our highschool phase of the program.</p>

                        <p>Bodhi arrived from Cartago, a nearby province. This two-toed sloth was found on the ground on top of his unresponsive mother and was brought to the Toucan Rescue Ranch, where Bodhi is receiving 24-hour care. The story is extremely tragic, but not entirely unusual for sloths in Costa Rica.</p>

                        <p>Luna, a three-fingered sloth, arrived on the evening of a full moon this last December. Her mother had fallen out of a tree and onto the road, and a passing driver, unable to stop in time, hit the fallen sloth. When they pulled over to see the extent of her injuries, they found that she had not survived, but miraculously her very young baby sloth still clinging to her had survived the terrible ordeal. </p>
